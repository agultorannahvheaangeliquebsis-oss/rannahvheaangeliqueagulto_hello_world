# IS-312
# **Framework Used**

The website that we built during class used Flask, that is a lightweight Python web framework.
Flask is usually used for small web applications and APIs because it is simple and easy to get started with.

# **How to run the application locally**
To run the application locally using PyCharm, first make sure that Python is installed on your computer and that a Python interpreter is configured in PyCharm. Create a new project in PyCharm, then install Flask by opening the built-in terminal and running pip install flask. After Flask is installed, create a Python file (for example, app.py) and paste the provided Flask code into it. To start the application, right-click the file in PyCharm and select Run, or run python app.py in the terminal. Once the program is running, open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to view the application output.
